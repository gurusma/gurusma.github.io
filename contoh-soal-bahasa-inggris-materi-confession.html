The Legend of Banyuwangi Once upon a time, in eastern tip of Java Island was led by a king named Prabu Sulahkromo. He was helped by Sidopekso, a handsome, strong, and kind advisor. Sidopekso's wife, Sri Tanjung, was so beautiful and kind that the king was attracted to her. One day, in order to persuade Sri Tanjung, the king had an idea. He ordered Sidopekso to carry out tasks that could not be fulfilled by ordinary humans. Without suspicion, Sidopekso set out to carry out the orders of the king. 1. 2. her. However, Sri Tanjung remained firm in her stance. As a wife, she always prayed for her husband. After Sidopekso had left, the king tried to get Sri Tanjung with many tricks. He even slandered When his love had been rejected by Sri Tanjung, the king was really angry. When Sidopekso returned from his mission, he went straight to the king. An evil idea came up in the king's mind. He told Sidopekso that after his leaving, his wife came and seduced the king. Without thinking, Sidopekso immediately went to see Sri Tanjung with anger and unfounded accusation. Questions: 3. Sri Tanjung's honest confession made Sidopekso angrier and even he angrily threatened his loyal wife. She was shocked because her husband didn't believe her. She then was dragged to the bank of a dirty and smelly river. Before Sidopekso did something to her, Sri Tanjung had said to her husband to prove her honesty and loyalty, "If my blood makes the river water smell bad, then I have done something wrong, but if the river water smells fragrant, then I am innocent." Sri Tanjung finally died at the hands of her husband. Her body was thrown in the river and gradually the river became clear and spread fragrant smell. Realizing what happened, Sidopekso staggered, fell to the ground, and became dazed. The fragrant smell of the river was the proof of her love for him. Fragrant river in Javanese is banyu wangi. The land around the fragrant river is known as Banyuwangi, a town in East Java. 1. What do you know about Sri Tanjung?2. Why did Sidopekso leave his wife? 3.Why was the king angry at Sri Tanjung? 4. What can we infer from the story? 5. Explain the characters of the story above!​</a>

                                            My Favorite Teacher
There are about forty teachers in my school.Most of them are kind and helpfu.But my favorite one is Mr. Henry,my English teacher.
Mr.Henry is tall and slim enough.He is about thirty years old.Mr.Henry is always netly dessed.To school h always carries a briefcase.He uses it to keep his books and other things.
I always look forwardto MrHenry's class becuse it is never boring.His jokes make his lessons interesting and lively.HHe always advises us to read more story books to improve our English.He also encourages us to do exercisesduring the weekend,like jogging and swimming.
Although Mr.Henry is usually humorous,he can be very stic at times .He likes to give a punishment to the errant students.He asks them to write a letter of confession.
Mr.Henry is also a caring person.Once I fell offmy bike and has a deep cut on my knee.He washed my wound and put medicine on it I was touched by kindness.
I am lucky to have a teacher like Mr.Henry he is friendly,dedicated,and experinced in his work.</a>

                                            HI!! Please check the grammar in this speech, I'm afraid there's something wrong or not quite right, please i need your help Honorable judges and everyone here today. Assalamualaikum wr.wb first of all, let’s give thanks to Allah SWT , it is because of him we are all able to attend this contest, secondly may shalawat and Salam always be delivered to our Prophet Nabi Muhammad saw, who had brought us from the darkness to this bright modern era that we live in today, and last but not least I like to thank the judges for giving me this very special opportunity to compete in this contest, ladies and gentlemen good afternoon, my name is Salsabila Ramadhani and I’m from Ten 3 standing here, in front of you all to deliver my speech, under the tittle of Save Our Culture. First, I will explain about the meaning of culture. Do you know the meaning of culture? Culture means life method which grow up on the society area which heir by generations to generations. We all know, we have a thousand legacy of culture which has a high precious of art and an ancestral masterpiece such as music, language, traditional dance, and cuisine. Along with the development of time, a passion for preserving culture is fading. Why? Because the advancement of science and technology, the impact of globalization, lack of awareness, And maybe they didn’t love their own nation Like Now that many teenagers are affected by globalization. For example, the teenagers when getting out of bed just looking for handphone to look notification from Whatsapp, Instagram, TikTok or message from someone special, maybe. And it’s true right? Indonesian teenagers right now is more into the modern music and they maybe already forgot Indonesian traditional music or they never know, one by one and step by step our culture is our culture is . And, Cant you see that? Foreign culture almost changes all about Indonesians life style too, from 3f, Food Fun and Fashion. Food, many kinds of food outside, a little get rid of the native foods area with modern food like spaghetti, and burgers. Also follow the trend of the clothes. It is like wore tight clothes, hotpants and semi-finished clothes. It is very very not worth for our nation that upholds modesty. It is ironic, really. But it is a fact, you know. All of us as the next generation of this nation, looks like not care at all. But why it happened? So, as the young generation, we must play role and take a part to perpetuate it. In this globalization era, west culture is easy to enter Indonesia, even grow and keep growing very fast. It looks like we feel more confident if we try to imitate the west culture. Another case is our culture confession by Malaysia. They claimed our culture as their for example like reog ponorogo, pendet dance, batik, rasa sayange song, and many more. This is is can be a motivation to us as young generatioNn to more care about Indonesias culture. We cant just blame them who had stole our culture. We must save our culture. Where do we have to start? Of course we should start from our own selves. If its not us who love our own cultures then who else would? We must feel proud in showing our self-esteems through our cultures. Start from our selves, our families, and our surroundings. Culture cant be produce as that easy, moreover in hurry. There are many efforts to perpetuate Indonesias culture, but that efforts arent maximum yet. Besides creativity, promotion factor has a big role too. Promote it into international level with an interesting and unique ideas. So, Indonesias culture has an international confession and difficult to duplicated. Don’t ever bored to make a creativity and save Indonesias cultures.. That’s all my speech, I hope my speech can open up our eyes and rise our spirits on to begin loving own cultures. The last I say Wassalamualaikum Wr. Wb. ​</a>

Mini konser Afgan Syah Reza yang bertajuk Afgan Punya Cerita berlangsung begitu meriah di Skeeno Hall Gandaria City, antusias para fans yang hadir pun ikut meramaikan suasana konser.
Atmosfer penonton bergemuruh ketika pria kelahiran Jakarta 27 Mei 1989 ini membuka konser lewat hits Katakan Tidak, yang dimedley dengan super hits Get Lucky milik duo Daft Punk. Kemeriahan Skeeno Hall pun semakin pecah kala Afgan menyajikan lagu andalan Terima Kasih Cinta.
Seperti biasanya, Afgan tampil sederhana. Ia memakai pakaian casual khasnya yang membuat semua mata terpana. Tidak heran, pria berlesung pipi tersebut selalu menawan tiap kali menyapa para fans.

Am I asking all these questions for nothing
I'm wondering if anyone's there
And I really need to make a confession
I hate to say that I'm a little bit scared
But I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
Praying that I don’t forget where I belong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
I’m praying that I don’t forget just who I am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand
I'm callin' all my friends after midnight, yeah
To remind 'em that I'll always be there for them
It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to
But it's good to know that somebody cares
'Cause I've been on this train too long
People gettin' off and on
I'm prayin' that I don't forget where I belong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand
'Cause we all get lost sometimes (yeah yeah)
We all get lost sometimes
We don't leave your heart behind (no, yeah)
We all get lost sometimes
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand oh who I am
When you wake up, your whole world is flipped
Is just different, and you gotta, you know, you gotta
You gotta go with it and
That's just simply growing up
And now I see it in a negative way
You have to see it as it has been giving to you
I mean, as much as time it's gonna be crazy
You're gonna feel like that's where we're supposed to be
You're not gonna feel out of place anymore
You're gonna feel that's where you're meant to be
You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time
You just let it go and
And grow with it, and you can't hold on
To the old you, or the old this or the old that
Because, you know, you change
And it's not changing in a bad way
It's just changing because that's what happens in life
You grow up, everyone moves on
You're just learning
You stay true to yourself
Changing isn't a bad thing and it never was
But at the end of the day you know, you're the same person
And, and where your heart is, that doesn't change
And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
And I just pray to God that I'm still who I am
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand yeah yeah
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand oh who I am</a>

The Legend of Banyuwangi Once upon a time, in eastern tip of Java Island was led by a king named Prabu Sulahkromo. He was helped by Sidopekso, a handsome, strong, and kind advisor. Sidopekso's wife, Sri Tanjung, was so beautiful and kind that the king was attracted to her. One day, in order to persuade Sri Tanjung, the king had an idea. He ordered Sidopekso to carry out tasks that could not be fulfilled by ordinary humans. Without suspicion, Sidopekso set out to carry out the orders of the king. 1. 2. her. However, Sri Tanjung remained firm in her stance. As a wife, she always prayed for her husband. After Sidopekso had left, the king tried to get Sri Tanjung with many tricks. He even slandered When his love had been rejected by Sri Tanjung, the king was really angry. When Sidopekso returned from his mission, he went straight to the king. An evil idea came up in the king's mind. He told Sidopekso that after his leaving, his wife came and seduced the king. Without thinking, Sidopekso immediately went to see Sri Tanjung with anger and unfounded accusation. Questions: 3. Sri Tanjung's honest confession made Sidopekso angrier and even he angrily threatened his loyal wife. She was shocked because her husband didn't believe her. She then was dragged to the bank of a dirty and smelly river. Before Sidopekso did something to her, Sri Tanjung had said to her husband to prove her honesty and loyalty, "If my blood makes the river water smell bad, then I have done something wrong, but if the river water smells fragrant, then I am innocent." Sri Tanjung finally died at the hands of her husband. Her body was thrown in the river and gradually the river became clear and spread fragrant smell. Realizing what happened, Sidopekso staggered, fell to the ground, and became dazed. The fragrant smell of the river was the proof of her love for him. Fragrant river in Javanese is banyu wangi. The land around the fragrant river is known as Banyuwangi, a town in East Java. 1. What do you know about Sri Tanjung?2. Why did Sidopekso leave his wife? 3.Why was the king angry at Sri Tanjung? 4.

Sidopekso left his wife to carry out tasks given by the king, without suspecting anything.</p><p>3.

                            15. HI!! Please check the grammar in this speech, I'm afraid there's something wrong or not quite right, please i need your help Honorable judges and everyone here today. Assalamualaikum wr.wb first of all, let’s give thanks to Allah SWT , it is because of him we are all able to attend this contest, secondly may shalawat and Salam always be delivered to our Prophet Nabi Muhammad saw, who had brought us from the darkness to this bright modern era that we live in today, and last but not least I like to thank the judges for giving me this very special opportunity to compete in this contest, ladies and gentlemen good afternoon, my name is Salsabila Ramadhani and I’m from Ten 3 standing here, in front of you all to deliver my speech, under the tittle of Save Our Culture. First, I will explain about the meaning of culture. Do you know the meaning of culture? Culture means life method which grow up on the society area which heir by generations to generations. We all know, we have a thousand legacy of culture which has a high precious of art and an ancestral masterpiece such as music, language, traditional dance, and cuisine. Along with the development of time, a passion for preserving culture is fading. Why? Because the advancement of science and technology, the impact of globalization, lack of awareness, And maybe they didn’t love their own nation Like Now that many teenagers are affected by globalization. For example, the teenagers when getting out of bed just looking for handphone to look notification from Whatsapp, Instagram, TikTok or message from someone special, maybe. And it’s true right? Indonesian teenagers right now is more into the modern music and they maybe already forgot Indonesian traditional music or they never know, one by one and step by step our culture is our culture is . And, Cant you see that? Foreign culture almost changes all about Indonesians life style too, from 3f, Food Fun and Fashion. Food, many kinds of food outside, a little get rid of the native foods area with modern food like spaghetti, and burgers. Also follow the trend of the clothes. It is like wore tight clothes, hotpants and semi-finished clothes. It is very very not worth for our nation that upholds modesty. It is ironic, really. But it is a fact, you know. All of us as the next generation of this nation, looks like not care at all. But why it happened? So, as the young generation, we must play role and take a part to perpetuate it. In this globalization era, west culture is easy to enter Indonesia, even grow and keep growing very fast. It looks like we feel more confident if we try to imitate the west culture. Another case is our culture confession by Malaysia. They claimed our culture as their for example like reog ponorogo, pendet dance, batik, rasa sayange song, and many more. This is is can be a motivation to us as young generatioNn to more care about Indonesias culture. We cant just blame them who had stole our culture. We must save our culture. Where do we have to start? Of course we should start from our own selves. If its not us who love our own cultures then who else would? We must feel proud in showing our self-esteems through our cultures. Start from our selves, our families, and our surroundings. Culture cant be produce as that easy, moreover in hurry. There are many efforts to perpetuate Indonesias culture, but that efforts arent maximum yet. Besides creativity, promotion factor has a big role too. Promote it into international level with an interesting and unique ideas. So, Indonesias culture has an international confession and difficult to duplicated. Don’t ever bored to make a creativity and save Indonesias cultures.. That’s all my speech, I hope my speech can open up our eyes and rise our spirits on to begin loving own cultures. The last I say Wassalamualaikum Wr. Wb. ​</h2><br />

Am I asking all these questions for nothing
I'm wondering if anyone's there
And I really need to make a confession
I hate to say that I'm a little bit scared
But I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
Praying that I don’t forget where I belong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
I’m praying that I don’t forget just who I am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand
I'm callin' all my friends after midnight, yeah
To remind 'em that I'll always be there for them
It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to
But it's good to know that somebody cares
'Cause I've been on this train too long
People gettin' off and on
I'm prayin' that I don't forget where I belong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand
'Cause we all get lost sometimes (yeah yeah)
We all get lost sometimes
We don't leave your heart behind (no, yeah)
We all get lost sometimes
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand oh who I am
When you wake up, your whole world is flipped
Is just different, and you gotta, you know, you gotta
You gotta go with it and
That's just simply growing up
And now I see it in a negative way
You have to see it as it has been giving to you
I mean, as much as time it's gonna be crazy
You're gonna feel like that's where we're supposed to be
You're not gonna feel out of place anymore
You're gonna feel that's where you're meant to be
You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time
You just let it go and
And grow with it, and you can't hold on
To the old you, or the old this or the old that
Because, you know, you change
And it's not changing in a bad way
It's just changing because that's what happens in life
You grow up, everyone moves on
You're just learning
You stay true to yourself
Changing isn't a bad thing and it never was
But at the end of the day you know, you're the same person
And, and where your heart is, that doesn't change
And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
And I just pray to God that I'm still who I am
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand yeah yeah
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand oh who I am</h2><br />
