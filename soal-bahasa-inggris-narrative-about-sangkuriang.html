The prince accepted the condition.<br /><br />They get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into a dog named Tumang. Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and hit Sangkuriang’s head with it. Dayang Sumbi was so sad; she didn’t pay any attention to Sangkuriang and started to cry.<br /><br />Sangkuriang feel sad and also confused. How can his mother love a dog more than him? Sangkuriang then decided to go away from their home and went on a journey. In the morning, Dayang Sumbi finally stopped crying. She started to feel better, so she went to find Sangkuriang. But her son was no where to be found. She looked everywhere but still couldn’t find him. Finally, she went home with nothing. She was exhausted. She fell asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.<br /><br />And time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the turban on his head. Dayang Sumbi was startled when she saw a scar on his head at the same place where she, years ago, hit Sangkuriang on the head.<br /><br />After the young man left, Dayang Sumbi prayed for guidance. After praying, she became convinced that the young man was indeed her missing son. She realized that she had to do something to prevent Sangkuriang from marrying her. But she did not wish to disappoint him by cancelling the wedding. So, although she agreed to marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.<br /><br />Sangkuriang accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost finished the boat.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.<br /><br />Sangkuriang’s genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu (Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung (from the word Bendung, which means Dam). <br />

Dadapan village was close to a wood so Jaka Tarub liked to go to the wood.  He liked hunting for animals with his blowpipe.<br />One day when he was in the wood he saw a beautiful rainbow and he saw seven angels went down through it.  He came closer and searched for them.  The seven angels were swimming and taking a bath in a lake.  Jaka Tarub looked at them while hiding behind trees.  When they had finished taking a bath, they flew through the rainbow to heaven.<br />The next day he saw the same thing again.  This time Jaka Tarub had an idea.  He searched for their dress and when he found them he took one of them.  As they had finished swimming and taking a bath, they looked for their dress.  One of them could not find her dress.  Her friends had to come back to heaven so they left her.  She was crying while staying in the water.  Jaka Tarub approached her.<br />‘Why are you crying lady?’<br />‘I lose my dress so I cannot go home’<br />‘Where is your home?’<br />‘I live in heaven.  I’m an angel.  My name is Nawang Wulan.  But I lose my dress so I cannot fly anymore’<br />‘I you don’t mind I will take my mother’s dress for you’<br />‘OK, please do’<br />‘Wait for me here, I’ll be back’<br />Then Jaka Tarub went home to take her mother’s dress and gave it to Nawang Wulan.

She had ability which far above human being.  She could cook rice with just a bar of rice and when it had done the bowl will be full of rice.  But there was one condition.  The bowl must not be opened before it has done.  Jaka Tarub was very surprised with her wife’s ability. He was very curious about it.  So when Nawang Wulan was away he opened the bowl.  Consequently Nawang’s spiritual power disappeared.  She had to cook as ordinary human being.<br />Several months later Nawang Wulan gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.  Her name was Nawang Sih.  The birth of Nawang Sih added happiness to Jaka Tarub and Nawang Wulan.<br />Since Nawang Wulan could not cook efficiently anymore, she needed more rice than usual.  The stock of rice in their store room diminished rapidly.  Then one day when she took rice there she was very surprised.  Nawang Wulan found her angel dress.  It was hidden there under piles of rice.  She immediately wore it and talked to Jaka Tarub.<br />‘My dear husband, now I know what you did to me’<br />‘Forgive me, my dear.  I admit that I did this because I love you’<br />‘I love you too.  But now I find my dress.  I must come back to heaven.  I am an angel.  My place is not here.  I have to go now’.<br />‘How about Nawang Sih?  She needs you’‘I will leave her but don’t worry.  I will take care of her.  Anytime she needs me I will be here.  For that purpose please build a tower. When Nawang Sih cries put her there then call my name. I will come immediately.  But I will be invisible to you.  Good bye dear’<br />Then Jaka Tarub built a tower behind his house.  Every time Nawang Sih cried he would put her there.  Nawang Wulan would come and take care of Nawang Sih.      ......

Sumbi. She was also smart and clever. Her beauty and intelligence made a
 prince from the heavenly kingdom of Kahyangan desire her as his wife. 
The prince asked permission from his father to marry Dayang Sumbi. 
People from Kahyangan could never live side by side with humans, but his
 father approved on one condition, when they had a child, the prince 
would transform into a dog. The prince accepted the condition.</p><p>They
 get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave 
birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into a dog named Tumang. 
Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his 
father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One 
day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His 
arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went 
home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was

red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false 
dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.</p><p>Sangkuriang’s
 genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from 
the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his 
anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a 
valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu 
(Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With

He always played with his very loyal dog, Tumang. He did not know that he was actually his father, because Dayang Sumbi hid the secret from him. Sangkuriang liked to hunt in the woods, of course with Tumang.</p><p>          One day Dayang Sumbi asked him to bring home a deer’s  heart. But, after hunting for several, he could not find any deer in the wood. He did not want to disappoint his mother and was thinking hard how to bring home a deer’s heart.

She saw the scar in Sangkuriang’s forehead, and soon she knew that he was her son, who left her a long time ago.

She wanted him to build a lake and a boat in just one night!</p><p>          Sangkuriang agreed, because he knew that he could make it with the help of his genies. By midnight he finished the lake and then started making the boat. Dayang Sumbi was thinking hard to find a way to fail him. Before dawn, she asked the people in the village to burn the woods in the East, and the light made all the cocks crow. Thinking that the night would be over soon, the genies ran fast and left Sangkuriang before the boat was finished. Sangkuriang realized that Dayang Sumbi had cheated him.

</p>Drink the water immediately to quench your thirst. Without realizing it, that air is King Sungging Perbangkara's senior air. Because of the power of Raja Sungging Perbangkara, the boar was pregnant after drinking its urine. Nine months later the boar starts a baby girl.
<p>
</p>king of Sungging Perbangkara knows about the existence of a baby girl born because of the artistic air. He also went to the forest to look for it. The baby girl is expected. He also said Dayang Sumbi and returned to the royal palace.
<p>
</p>Court Lady Sunbi grew up to be a very beautiful woman. It felt like the countless kings, princes and nobles who wanted to marry the daughter of King Sungging Perbangkara. However, all the proposals were rejected by Dayang Sumbi smoothly. Not at all rejected by Dayang Sumbi, those who were rejected by the proposal fought each other to fight over themselves.
<p>
</p>Dayang Sumbi was very sad to understand the reality of the princes, kings and nobles whom he refused to fight each other. He also begged King Sungging Perbangkara to exile himself. The King finally allows you to isolate yourself. Dayang Sumbi secluded herself on a hill accompanied by a male dog named the tumang. To fill his spare time while in exile, Dayang Sumbi also weaved.
<p>
</p>Once upon a time, the compilation of Dayang Sumbi was weaving, weaving equipment fell. At that time Dayang Sumbi took it lazy to take it. Throwing words that he did not need to realize. "Whoever receives the fallen weaving equipment, if I were a man I would make a husband, if he were a woman he would be my brother."
<p>
</p>None of them took the fallen weaving equipment and gave it to Dayang Sumbi.
<p>
</p>There was nothing that Dayang Sumbi could do other than fulfill her words. He was married to Si Tumang who turned out to be incarnation of a god. The Tumang is a god who is cursed into an animal and thrown to earth. A few months after marriage, Dayang Sumbi was pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy. Dayang Sumbi received the name Sangkuriang.

Sangkuriang invited the tumang to chase the deer Very strange, the Tumang who is usually obedient, the compilation did not obey his orders. Sangkuriang became angry. He said. "If asked to remain not according to my instructions, surely I will kill you."
<p>
</p>The threat of Sangkuriang seems to be ignored by Tumang. Because annoyed and angry, then Sangkuriang killed the Tumang. He took the black dog's heart and brought it home. Sangkuriang gives the Tumang's heart to be submitted for cooking.
<p>
</p>Unknowingly Dayang Sumbi, who was given the heart, was given. He then cooks and processes it. So, Dayang Sumbi's anger at Sangkuriang cannot be compiled, she knows that the heart she eats is the heart of the Tumang. He then grabbed a dipper made from a coconut shell and hit Sangkuriang's head, until Sangkuriang's head was injured.
<p>
</p>Sangkuriang was very angry and hurt by the guidance. According to him, his mother loved the Tumang more than he. So, without saying goodbye to Dayang Sumbi, Sangkuriang then wandered eastward.
<p>
</p>Dayang Sumbi was very sorry after learning about the departure of Sangkuriang the goat. He also imprisoned and begged forgiveness to the gods for the mistakes he made. The gods heard the request of Dayang Sumbi, they accepted the apology and gave Dayang Sumbi eternal beauty.
<p>
</p>Syahdan, Sangkuriang continues to wander without a definite purpose. In his wanderings, Sangkuriang continued to increase his magic by studying for magic people he met during his wandering. For years Sangkuriang wandered without realizing he returned to the place whereAll Done!!Nice To meet You<p></p><br />

                        The Fish and the Salamander At the beginning of time, Fish and Salamander looked very much alike. They were discussing how they planned to evolve. "I wish to grow thinner, with a broad tail," said Fish. "Then, I will swim like lightning and outrace any pond creature. How about you?" Salamander considered, "Well, it would certainly be nice to be the fastest creature in the pond. However, I think will keep my awkward tail, which allows me to swim well enough. What I wish to change instead is to grow modest legs" Fish laughed. "Legs? In a pond? What a waste!" Soon, though, came a drought and the pond began to dry up. Fish was trapped, but Salamander was able to crawl out, to find another pond. "How did you know that legs would come in so handy?" cried Fish to its departing friend. "I didn't," said Salamander, "But I wasn't so naive as to assume that circumstances today would be the same as that of tomorrow." The story tells us that versatility is a lead to Success.<br />

They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures.

The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />

                            40. sangkuriang dalam bahasa inggris dan contoh soalnya</h2><br />
                        Once
 upon a time, a beautiful lady named Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a boy 
which she named Sangkuriang. When Sangkuriang was old enough to hunt, he
 took his mother’s dog Tumang (which according to this legend is an 
incarnation of a god and also Sangkuriang’s father) and ordered Tumang 
to chase after a boar. When Tumang did not follow Sangkuriang’s order, 
Sangkuriang became very angry and he killed Tumang. He carved out 
Tumang’s heart and brought it back to his mother.<br />Dayang
 Sumbi took the heart, cooked it and ate it. When she discovered that 
the heart belonged to Tumang, her husband, she was overcome with wrath. 
She sent her son away, but not before she hit him with a spoon and left a
 deep scar on his head.<br />Sangkuriang
 travelled around the world. After a long while, he arrived back in his 
village again without recognizing it. He saw a beautiful lady and fell 
in love with her. Little did he know that she was his own mother. He 
asked for her hand in marriage and she agreed.<br />Dayang
 Sumbi later realized that Sangkuriang was her son, as she recognized 
the scar that she had inflicted. She tried to tell him and break off the
 wedding, but he didn’t believe her and insisted to go on with the 
wedding. Dayang Sumbi then set an impossible condition that Sangkuriang 
has to fulfill in order to marry her: he should build her a big boat and
 a lake by damming Citarum river, all within one night, and it shall be 
finished by dawn. Sangkuriang agreed to the condition.<br />He
 built a boat from a large tree, and with the help of spirits, he dammed
 the Citarum river with landslides. The water eventually rose and filled
 the plain, turning it into a lake. When dawn was near, he was almost 
ready. Dayang Sumbi realized this, so she prayed for divine 
intervention. As an answer to her prayers, the eastern horizon lit up. 
Deceived by the lights, cocks crowed and farmers rose for the new day, 
thinking that dawn has broken.<br />Sangkuriang
 was also deceived. He thought his endeavor has failed. Angrily, he 
kicked the boat so that it toppled over. This boat became Tangkuban 
Parahu mountain (tangkuban means upside down, and parahu means boat). 
The pile of leftover woods became Mt. Burangrang, and the rest of the 
big tree became Mt. Bukit Tunggul. The lake became lake Bandung (which 
literally means ‘dam’).<br /><br />
