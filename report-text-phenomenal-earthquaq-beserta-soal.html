                                            My experienced at Pay It Forward Farm was phenomenal . That summer , after receiving a funding grant from my school for the planned internship , I packed my Jeep , said my goodbyes and hit the road for New Hampshire . For six weeks I lived with a dynamic influx of young people and my foster farm family . Our days were never uneventful . There were always projects , meetings , and things to be done . In the gardens , we planted , watered , weeded , and harvested . We taught kids about where their food comes from , and watched them as they planted seeds in the soil . We met with other farmers in the area and supported them at farmers markets , work parties , and provided emotional support during slaughterings . When the sun set and the days were done , our family gathered to cook together and sit around the kitchen table or the old wooden electric spool outside , laughing off the trials of the day and toasting to the successes . We cooked for each other , sharing favorite recipes and stories . We held parties with our farming friends , where any and all we ran into were invited and offered whatever food and drinks we had . We spent our nights under the stars talking , sometimes about heady epistemological ideas and hopes for the future and other times about joys and frustations from the day . We laughed a lot , sometimes we cried . I think once or twice , there was some yelling , but man , we just lived . During these weeks existence was materially simple yet spiritually rich , and I felt much happiness as a result . Almost every step along the way , from planting , to harvesting , to purchasing and consuming , we knew the face of that member of our local food system . This was the ideal .

                                            During a relatively short period at the end of the nineteenth century, George Eastman was instrumental in transforming the labor-intensive and expensive art of photography into a popular and affordable hobby. The phenomenal success that Eastman had in these early years of his business was in most part due to the successful innovation that opened up photography to the population as a whole.
While Eastman was working as a bookkeeper in a bank in Rochester, New York, he spent his leisure time working on a process for making dry plates. By 1880, Eastman had perfected the process. Without leaving his job at the bank, he established the Eastman Dry Plate Company. The business grew so quickly that by 1881 Eastman had given up his job at the bank in order to develop the business.
Changes to simplify the process of taking photographs followed one after another. In 1884, Eastman took a step that made photography a less cumbersome process: he replaced the unwieldy glass plates with paper-backed roll film. Four years later, the hand-held Kodak was introduced. This camera came loaded with enough film to take a hundred photographs and produced round-shaped pictures approximately six centimeters in diameter. Something that made this camera very popular was that a photographer did not need to know how to develop film in order to use it; after using up the film, the photographer sent the loaded camera back to the factory, where the photographs were processed and the camera was reloaded and returned to its owner. In 1892, another innovation, film that could be loaded in the daylight, allowed amateur photographers to load their own film successfully.

                                            Rainbow
Rainbow is an optical and meteorological phenomenal that produces the spectrum of light in the sky when the sun shines when it rains. Sequence, the color is red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. Rainbow produced when light refracts through water droplets in the air. 	That's why the rainbow is always seen after rain. It's curved in the air as water droplets spherical. But usually the bottom of the rainbow "protected" by the earth. Rainbow phenomenal can also be seen with the back of the sun and spray water on a sunny day. Rainbow occurs due to refraction of sunlight by the drops. When the sunshine pass through water droplets, such as when it was refracted through a prism of glass. So in the droplets of water, we've got a different color from one side to the other water droplets. Some of the colored light is then reflected from the far side on the droplets of water, again and again out of the water droplets.

Wildebeest Migration Kenya: phenomenal wildebeest migration Kenya
By Robert Muhoho
Wildebeest Migration to and back from Serengeti into the Maasai Mara is the single most popular wildlife spectacle in Kenya. The Wildebeest Migration is such a phenomenon it involves movement of over 1 million wildebeest. It’s awesome to see the animals Crossing plains and rivers in the Mara wildebeest migration. River crossings are the most spectacular where the wildebeest jump into rivers full of crocodiles and surging currents.
The Wildebeest Migration 
What gives the wildebeest its worldwide repute is not its body structure however, but the sheer numbers and spectacle created by its migration. The animals migrate between the Serengeti and Mara Savannahs in Tanzania and Kenya respectively, in search of grass and water. It is estimated that over 1 million of these animals are on the move during the annual migration between June and October.         
Wildebeest River Crossing 
The most dramatic and memorable safari experience is when you observe the migrating wildebeest at the several Mara river crossings. Numbers upon numbers of wildebeest gather at such crossings unsure of their next move. The crossings are such notorious spots that the gnus have developed a self preservation instinct over time. 
Wildebeest will amass in their thousands at banks of river Mara which is rife with the dreaded Nile crocodile and raging currents. Put in the swift current, eminent stampedes and jaw snapping crocodiles in this picture and you get a guaranteed recipe for mass genocide at such river crossings. The Maasai Mara River is usually awash with bloated mass of wildebeest carcass that crocodiles feast on for days on end. 
Over 250,000 of the wildebeest die from drowning, stampede, crocodiles and the predators every year. But even this annual carnage is not enough to reduce their numbers. The wildebeest deaths during migration are replenished by the over 400,000 births a year. The deaths during migration are now considered as a natural population check; natural selection at its best.

Engineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and system to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but no always) using results and techniques form sciense.the development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, mathematical, linguistic, and historical knowledge, to achieve some practical result.               Technology is often consequence of sciense and engineering-although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields.for example, sciense might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors, by using already-existing tools and knowledge.this new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines, such as semiconductors, computers, and other forms of advanced technologists;the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.Tolong buat kn kesimpulannya ya,​</a>

                            12. My experienced at Pay It Forward Farm was phenomenal . That summer , after receiving a funding grant from my school for the planned internship , I packed my Jeep , said my goodbyes and hit the road for New Hampshire . For six weeks I lived with a dynamic influx of young people and my foster farm family . Our days were never uneventful . There were always projects , meetings , and things to be done . In the gardens , we planted , watered , weeded , and harvested . We taught kids about where their food comes from , and watched them as they planted seeds in the soil . We met with other farmers in the area and supported them at farmers markets , work parties , and provided emotional support during slaughterings . When the sun set and the days were done , our family gathered to cook together and sit around the kitchen table or the old wooden electric spool outside , laughing off the trials of the day and toasting to the successes . We cooked for each other , sharing favorite recipes and stories . We held parties with our farming friends , where any and all we ran into were invited and offered whatever food and drinks we had . We spent our nights under the stars talking , sometimes about heady epistemological ideas and hopes for the future and other times about joys and frustations from the day . We laughed a lot , sometimes we cried . I think once or twice , there was some yelling , but man , we just lived . During these weeks existence was materially simple yet spiritually rich , and I felt much happiness as a result . Almost every step along the way , from planting , to harvesting , to purchasing and consuming , we knew the face of that member of our local food system . This was the ideal .

                            16. During a relatively short period at the end of the nineteenth century, George Eastman was instrumental in transforming the labor-intensive and expensive art of photography into a popular and affordable hobby. The phenomenal success that Eastman had in these early years of his business was in most part due to the successful innovation that opened up photography to the population as a whole.
While Eastman was working as a bookkeeper in a bank in Rochester, New York, he spent his leisure time working on a process for making dry plates. By 1880, Eastman had perfected the process. Without leaving his job at the bank, he established the Eastman Dry Plate Company. The business grew so quickly that by 1881 Eastman had given up his job at the bank in order to develop the business.
Changes to simplify the process of taking photographs followed one after another. In 1884, Eastman took a step that made photography a less cumbersome process: he replaced the unwieldy glass plates with paper-backed roll film. Four years later, the hand-held Kodak was introduced. This camera came loaded with enough film to take a hundred photographs and produced round-shaped pictures approximately six centimeters in diameter. Something that made this camera very popular was that a photographer did not need to know how to develop film in order to use it; after using up the film, the photographer sent the loaded camera back to the factory, where the photographs were processed and the camera was reloaded and returned to its owner. In 1892, another innovation, film that could be loaded in the daylight, allowed amateur photographers to load their own film successfully.

                        Selama periode yang relatif singkat pada akhir abad kesembilan belas, George Eastman berperan penting dalam mengubah seni fotografi padat karya dan mahal menjadi hobi yang populer dan terjangkau. Kesuksesan fenomenal yang dialami Eastman di tahun-tahun awal bisnisnya ini sebagian besar disebabkan oleh inovasi yang berhasil yang membuka fotografi bagi populasi secara keseluruhan. Sementara Eastman bekerja sebagai pemegang buku di sebuah bank di Rochester, New York, dia menghabiskan waktu luangnya untuk mengerjakan sebuah proses pembuatan piring kering. Pada tahun 1880, Eastman telah menyempurnakan prosesnya. Tanpa meninggalkan pekerjaannya di bank, dia mendirikan Eastman Dry Plate Company. Bisnis berkembang dengan sangat cepat sehingga pada tahun 1881 Eastman telah melepaskan pekerjaannya di bank untuk mengembangkan bisnisnya. Perubahan menyederhanakan proses pengambilan foto diikuti satu demi satu. Pada tahun 1884, Eastman mengambil langkah yang membuat fotografi menjadi proses yang kurang rumit: ia mengganti piring kaca berat dengan film roll yang didukung kertas. Empat tahun kemudian, Kodak yang dipegang tangan diperkenalkan. Kamera ini dilengkapi dengan cukup banyak film untuk mengambil seratus foto dan menghasilkan gambar berbentuk bulat berdiameter sekitar enam sentimeter. Sesuatu yang membuat kamera ini sangat populer adalah seorang fotografer tidak perlu tahu bagaimana mengembangkan film agar bisa menggunakannya; Setelah menggunakan film tersebut, fotografer mengirim kamera yang terpasang kembali ke pabrik, tempat foto-foto itu diproses dan kamera diload dan dikembalikan ke pemiliknya. Pada tahun 1892, inovasi lain, film yang bisa dimuat di siang hari, memungkinkan fotografer amatir untuk memuat film mereka sendiri dengan sukses.<br />

                            22. Rainbow
Rainbow is an optical and meteorological phenomenal that produces the spectrum of light in the sky when the sun shines when it rains. Sequence, the color is red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. Rainbow produced when light refracts through water droplets in the air. 	That's why the rainbow is always seen after rain. It's curved in the air as water droplets spherical. But usually the bottom of the rainbow "protected" by the earth. Rainbow phenomenal can also be seen with the back of the sun and spray water on a sunny day. Rainbow occurs due to refraction of sunlight by the drops. When the sunshine pass through water droplets, such as when it was refracted through a prism of glass. So in the droplets of water, we've got a different color from one side to the other water droplets. Some of the colored light is then reflected from the far side on the droplets of water, again and again out of the water droplets.

Wildebeest Migration Kenya: phenomenal wildebeest migration Kenya
By Robert Muhoho
Wildebeest Migration to and back from Serengeti into the Maasai Mara is the single most popular wildlife spectacle in Kenya. The Wildebeest Migration is such a phenomenon it involves movement of over 1 million wildebeest. It’s awesome to see the animals Crossing plains and rivers in the Mara wildebeest migration. River crossings are the most spectacular where the wildebeest jump into rivers full of crocodiles and surging currents.
The Wildebeest Migration 
What gives the wildebeest its worldwide repute is not its body structure however, but the sheer numbers and spectacle created by its migration. The animals migrate between the Serengeti and Mara Savannahs in Tanzania and Kenya respectively, in search of grass and water. It is estimated that over 1 million of these animals are on the move during the annual migration between June and October.         
Wildebeest River Crossing 
The most dramatic and memorable safari experience is when you observe the migrating wildebeest at the several Mara river crossings. Numbers upon numbers of wildebeest gather at such crossings unsure of their next move. The crossings are such notorious spots that the gnus have developed a self preservation instinct over time. 
Wildebeest will amass in their thousands at banks of river Mara which is rife with the dreaded Nile crocodile and raging currents. Put in the swift current, eminent stampedes and jaw snapping crocodiles in this picture and you get a guaranteed recipe for mass genocide at such river crossings. The Maasai Mara River is usually awash with bloated mass of wildebeest carcass that crocodiles feast on for days on end. 
Over 250,000 of the wildebeest die from drowning, stampede, crocodiles and the predators every year. But even this annual carnage is not enough to reduce their numbers. The wildebeest deaths during migration are replenished by the over 400,000 births a year. The deaths during migration are now considered as a natural population check; natural selection at its best.
